"SWHelp the 2120 Salisbury train from Waterloo. Not really getting much info guys. <BR> SWHelp So it was incorrectly coupled? Really? Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors magically worked. Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out. <BR> On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 13 <BR> teams faultfinding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The trains failsafe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 23 <BR> Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using onboard monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action. DB 33 <BR> SWHelp So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train its not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? Thats your statement? <BR> On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a pullaway test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100 contacts on the train 13 <BR> type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of failsafe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 23 <BR> which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically. DB 33 <BR> SWHelp Whilst Im still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! <BR> No worries Im ex traincrew, so this is rather my specialist topic! Appreciate that it seems a little antiquated, but its all vetted and okayed by the safety bodies. Its similar to the modern trains, where resolving problems can often come down to turning off the 12 <BR> trains management systems and turning them back on again! DB 22 <BR> SWHelp Ahh that makes sense, thought the response was a little more detailed than usual. As a regular passenger I like understanding more, helps me to work around problems and know when to make alternative plans. Its amazing how often turning it off and on again actually works <BR> I always try to give something a bit more detailed, running a railway often has a lot more to it than it appears I was recently conversing with about emissions standards, which was an interesting research topic. Benefits of 6 years experience though! DB <BR> SWHelp Keep up the good work! <BR>","Customer is asking that salisbury train from waterloo.

"So obvious why BritishAirways a failing, T5 completely DEAD, more staff then passengers, terrible customer service, amp still cant get on my plane even though it was not due to leave for 50min. <BR> Hi Thamin, if you arrived after checkin for your flight had closed we wouldnt be able to accept you for the flight. Even if the airport is quiet, check in times still need to be met. Natalie <BR> BritishAirways Natalie I was 5min late. Plane wasnt expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, would guess the plane was tooIm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help. <BR> Hi Thamin, Im afraid this isnt something we can offer any flexibility with. Its not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesnt allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when its 12 <BR> busy. I can understand your disappointment, but its your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes. Beth S. 22 <BR> BritishAirways Just for clarification so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin? Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please. <BR> BritishAirways And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late checkins? <BR> Were sorry, Thamim. If you follow this link, it does advise you <LINK> Click check in essentials. It is your responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time. <BR> BritishAirways Youve not answered all my questions I take my responsibility for being 5min late, but your staff could have easily assessed its not busy and check me in. <BR> We appreciate the points youve raised, Thamim.

We hope you understand we have to be fair and consistent with all of our passengers. 12 <BR> This means our staff wouldnt have been able to make an exception when you travelled. We hope this message helps to clarify our position. 22 DaniH <BR> BritishAirways Thank you for the response but it doesnt suffice and is unacceptable, youre flights are always delayed and customers get no compensation. You also make different exceptions for different people it seems <BR> EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim. Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control. Were sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised its your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 12 <BR> airport and check in, in time for your flight. Were unable to hold a flight for a passenger if they are late. Our position remains unchanged. Natalie 22 <BR> BritishAirways Natalie do me favour, lets quantify this how long on average it takes to get from checkin desk to the furthest boarding gates at T5? <BR> BritishAirways And for the record I wasnt asking you to hold a flight, the plane wasnt due to leave for 50min and it was still delayed by 20min <BR> Hi Thamin.

If youre late to check in, there isnt any way for you to make the flight, even if the flight is delayed. Were sorry you remain disappointed with our response.

"Delta I was wanting to look into possibly upgrading my seat GINX36 but the seating chart says 1st class and delta comfort are all gone. Thats impossible. <BR> Hi Freddie, thanks for contacting us. My apologies for the inconvenience. One moment while I look into this further. HML <BR> Thanks for your patience. Im showing First Class is sold out for your flights however, Delta Comfort is available. The Delta Comfort cabin is sold as a fare for this market therefore, in order to confirm Comfort there will be a difference in the fare. HML <BR> Delta What does this upgrade list mean? <LINK> <BR> Delta And this one for the first leg of the flight? <LINK> <BR> It looks like there may an error between our system and the app. Im checking into this now. HML <BR> Delta ive heard about airlines blocking out seats for the purpose of overbooking and juggling to squeeze profits. I didnt know you guys were still doing that or doing it period <BR> Thanks for your patience. I am showing seats available in First Class however, the lower First Class fares are not available. Once your reservation is changed to the First Class cabin, you will be able to view and assign seats. HML <BR> You may see more availability closer to the time of travel. HML <BR> Delta This explanation sounds very convoluted. 1st there was no seats available, now there are seats, but there are no more lower 1st class fares available? Whats does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. Thats the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka HML <BR> Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. HML <BR> If youre using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. HML <BR> Delta What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like Ive been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased? <BR> To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of 200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket however, this does not include taxes and fees. HML <BR> The estimated cost is 1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased. Please contact our International Reservation specialist at 18002414141.
