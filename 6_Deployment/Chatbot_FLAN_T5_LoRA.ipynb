Nick <BR> Tesco Well theres pretty obvious shop lifters regularly, and today we had a man clearly intoxicated screaming and randomly asking people things. <BR> Thanks for taking the time to provide these details, can you just confirm its the Express store? TYPhil <BR> Tesco Yes the express store! Thanks aswell. Id review the CCTV from when security were removed. If customers can see the changes you will too! <BR> Hi there. I have spoken to the store. They have had a few problems recently and are looking into improving security. Thanks Ian <BR> Tesco Thank you again. I often worry for the staff as it is becoming a hot spot for undesirables. The homeless arent the issue to save confusion! <BR> Hi there, thank you for bringing this to our attention the last thing we want is our customers to feel unsafe.
